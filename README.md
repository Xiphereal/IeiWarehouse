# Bibliographic references Warehouse
## Project context
This application is a college project for the *Interoperability and data Integration* course. The porpuse was to learn how to develop a demo application integrating (pun intended) several techniques for data integration we learned about during the course: REST APIs, warehousing, data source wrappers, semantical mappings between the data sources and our data schema, etc. 

Most of the relevant info about the developing process is in this repo (PRs, issues, etc.). 

## What did I learn
- Perform data integration with warehousing.
- Extract data from JSON object.
- Design and implement the needed mappings between the data sources and our canonical schema.
- Basic usage of Selenium 4 for data scraping at the Google Scholar website.
- Basic usage of Gradle:
	- Building a multi-module based project.
	- Run the different task manually and understanding the Gradle environment.
	- Different notations and implications for defining dependencies.
- Using the MySQL workbench for modeling the database schema and generate the SQL script from it. Also reverse de process, obtaning the database schema from a SQL script.
- Implementation of basic REST API with Spring Boot.
- Develop a basic web frontend with Vaadin.
